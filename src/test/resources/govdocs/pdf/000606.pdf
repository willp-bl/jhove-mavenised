RE: Human Research Subject Protections Under Federalwide Assurance (FWA) 645

      Research Project: Prospective, Randomized, Multi-Center Trial of Pulmonary Artery
      Catheter (PAC) vs. Central Venous Catheter (CVC) for Management of Acute Lung
      Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Prospective,
      Randomized, Multi-Center Trial of ‘Fluid Conservative’ vs. ‘Fluid Liberal’
      Management of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
      (ARDS) (FACTT Trial)
      Principal Investigator: Alan H. Morris, M.D.

Dear Mr. Hanrahan:

The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) has reviewed Intermountain Health Care/Urban
North Region's and McKay-Dee Hospital Center's (MDH) September 2, 2003 and April 13, 2004
reports responding to determinations of noncompliance with Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) regulations for the protection of human subjects involving the above-referenced research.

Based upon its review, OHRP finds that MDH has implemented the required actions stipulated by
OHRP’s July 25, 2003 letter. In particular, OHRP acknowledges the following:

      (1) The MDH Institutional Review Board (IRB) received the additional supplemental information
      and the revised model informed consent document for the FACTT trial, and has subsequently re-
      reviewed and approved the research.

      (2) MDH has provided OHRP with a copy of the final version of the IRB-approved informed

      consent document.

      (3) MDH has implemented a variety of procedures including the development of an application
      for investigators, and a protocol review standard and risk benefit assessment for IRB members
      to ensure that the protocol contains sufficient information to make the determinations required
      under HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.111. To ensure that the informed consent document
      satisfies all requirements of HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.116, MDH has developed an
      informed consent checklist which IRB members use when reviewing informed consent
      documents.

OHRP finds that the above corrective actions adequately address OHRP’s findings and are
appropriate under the MDH FWA. As a result, OHRP anticipates no need for further involvement
with MDH related to this matter.

OHRP appreciates the continued commitment of your institution to the protection of human research
subjects. Please do not hesitate to contact us should you have any questions.

Sincerely,




Kristina Borror, Ph.D.                                    Michael A. Carome, M.D.
